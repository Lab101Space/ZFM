        <p>
            To enable the identification of zero-force members in a truss through qualitative analysis, rather than numerical computation, 
            a comprehensive step-by-step explanation is essential. This approach demands the application of specific rules tailored for a qualitative, 
            node-by-node examination of the structure. The foundation for these rules lies in the principles of equilibrium conditions, 
            which provide the necessary justification for this analytical method. Below, we detail these rules and their rationale within the framework of equilibrium.

              This node does not have any other members attached to it nor does it bear any horizontal loads. 
              Furthermore, each of these members is connected to a pin support at its opposite end.

              A horizontal force cannot be present at the roller support, 
              otherwise the substructure becomes unstable as it can undego rigid-body movement in the horizontal direction at the roller.
              Any other forces applied at the ends of the two members are absorbed by the supports, hence, the members remain force-free.
